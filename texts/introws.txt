Drones Introductory Workshop

Our Drones Introductory Workshop was a great success! Participants explored the fundamentals of drone technology, learned about flight safety, and got hands-on experience piloting drones. From beginners to enthusiasts, everyone had the chance to engage with real-world applications and improve their flying skills.
